<h1><strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</strong></h1>
<p><em>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for electronic mail (e-mail) transmission</em></p>

<h2><strong>What is SMTP?</strong></h2>

<p>SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, in which a mail sender communicates with a mail receiver by issuing simple command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.
When we send an e-mail message from our computer to another computer, it will go trough many different servers before it actually reaches our recipient's computer. The first stop for our e-mail message is an SMTP e-mail server. This server communicates directly with our computer using a protocol named SMTP. It is the de facto standard for e-mail transmission from clients to mail servers via the Internet. SMTP is an old protocol and was used already in the 1980s to transfer messages between computers.</p>

<li>Its objective is to transfer mail reliably and efficiently</li>
<li>SMTP is the IETF's Standard Number 10, or STD0010</li>
<li>Standard e-mail formats are also closely related to the SMTP standard</li>
